Launches Maven by executing the specified Java Virtual Machine (JVM) configuration, setting environment variables, and downloading the maven-wrapper.jar if necessary<br>- The script also provides a standardized way to retrieve command-line arguments for both Windows and non-Windows executions.

Please note that I've avoided using technical implementation details and focused on what the code achieves, as per your request.</td>
